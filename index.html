  <h4 class="center"> Early Life
    <p> Mary W. Jackson grew up in Hampton, Virginia. After graduating with highest honors from high school, she then continued her education at Hampton Institute, earning her Bachelor of Science Degrees in Mathematics and Physical Science. Following graduation, Mary taught in an all-black segregated mathematics school in Maryland prior to joining NASA.
      
      <h4 class="center"> Career
        <p> Mary Jackson was a mathematician and aerospace engineer. In 1951 she joined the West Computers at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and in 1958 she became the first black female engineer at NASA.
          
          <h4 class="center"> Legacy - How does she live on to this day?
            <p> Jackson's math and science skills earned her a position as a "human computer" for NASA, and she later became NASA's first black female engineer. Along with serving a vital role in the development of the space program, she helped other women and minorities advance their careers.
